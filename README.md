# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to using the `$in` operator with an empty array in MongoDB queries.

When you use `$in` with an empty array, you might expect it to behave like a wildcard that matches any document.  However, MongoDB interprets this as a condition that cannot be met, and returns an empty result set.

This repository includes example code that reproduces this issue and a solution to address it. This is especially relevant when dealing with dynamic queries where the array might sometimes be empty.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator, when used with an empty array `[]`, always returns an empty result set. This is true irrespective of whether the field exists in the documents or not.

## Solution
The solution involves using a conditional statement to check if the array is empty. If empty, it bypasses the `$in` condition to obtain the expected result.
